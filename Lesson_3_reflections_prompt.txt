When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  when there are more than one contributors to the project, then we can keep our code
  to a remote repository where others can see and can edit them.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Pulling changes manually help us in remembering the last time we synced with our github account so that we could 
	differenctiate between the commits of the two different branches of our local and remote repository.
	New changes in the remote repository should not go unnoticed by the developer.
